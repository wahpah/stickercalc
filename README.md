# 🧮 FakeCalc

This project creates a **fake iPhone Calculator app** for use in magic routines. It loads a fullscreen image that mimics the real iOS calculator—untouchable, perfectly positioned, and visually identical.

👉 **[Launch the illusion](https://andyjermann.github.io/fakecalc)**  
*Optimized specifically for iPhone 15 Pro Max*

---

## ⚠️ Device Compatibility

This version is **custom-fit** to an iPhone 15 Pro Max.  
On smaller iPhones (or those with different screen dimensions), the layout may shift, scale oddly, or reveal the trick.

## 🛠️ Want to Make Your Own?

Follow these steps to create a version tailored to your own device:

### 1. Take a Screenshot
- Open the Calculator app on your iPhone
- Make sure it shows a clean `0`
- Take a screenshot

### 2. Crop the Screenshot
- Open the image in **Photos → Edit**
- Crop off the **top status bar** (time, battery, etc.)
- Save the image as `calc-zero.jpg`

### 3. Use This Repo as a Template
- Download or fork this repository  
- [Click here to view the current `index.html`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andyjermann/fakecalc/main/index.html)
- Replace `calc-zero.jpg` with your own cropped screenshot
- Optionally update the `index.html` file to tweak any styling if needed

### 4. Host It
- Create a free GitHub account (if you don’t have one)
- Upload your image and HTML file into a repository
- In your repo, go to **Settings → Pages**
- Choose:
  - Source: `main`
  - Folder: `/ (root)`
- Save and wait a minute for your GitHub Pages site to go live  
  → You’ll get a link like: `https://yourusername.github.io/yourproject`

### 5. Add to Home Screen

To complete the illusion and make the fake app indistinguishable from the real one:

1. Open your GitHub Pages site in **Safari**
2. Tap **Share → Add to Home Screen**
3. Rename the app to: **Calculator**
4. Tap **Add**

> 🧠 The Calculator icon (`calc-icon.png`) is already included in this project. When you add it to your Home Screen, Safari will automatically use it as the app icon—no extra steps required.



Want to switch to the **real Calculator app** mid-performance?

Try:
- Setting up a **Shortcut** that opens Calculator
- Trigger it with a Back Tap, triple-click of the Side Button (via Accessibility Shortcut), or the Action Button (on supported models)
- Result: you flip the phone face-up… and the prediction is already there. 🔥
